# ScreenShotButton
Android app that shows overlay screen shot button.

### Feature
- Showing post view after shooting.
- Automatically detect and retry issues with black screen shots on some devices.
- OSS, no pay, no ad, no tracking.

### Disclaimer
- **Video capturing requires Android 8+**, and also it's still a pilot implementation.
- To reduce the load, the shutter lag is slightly larger.
- if the overlay button was closed on your device, please check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ .
